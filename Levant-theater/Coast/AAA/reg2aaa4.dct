desc = [[The port of Tartus is famous for containing a Soviet resupply base, and because of that, it's well equipped to maintain and refit warships. In the longer term, we plan to deny the Syrians access to naval facilities and soviet equipment, but first, you must deal with enemy air defenses in the vicinity, including a AAA battery north of the port, and the SA-8 site inside of the harbor.

Caution, do not attack any of the soviet warships. You are only authorized to enter the no-fly zone to attack Syrian air defenses.

Primary objective: Destroy at least half of the AAA battery.

Secondary objective: Eliminate the SA-8.

Threats: AAA, MANPADS and SA-8. SA-3 and SA-2 sites close. Soviet ships may engage if previously shot at.

Recommended pilots: 2]]
